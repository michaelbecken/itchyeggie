李 柏 誼   
[Léih Paak Yìh]

Äggie Pak-yee Lee, b. 1989 British Hong Kong, graduated in Estonia

Animated-film Director/ Artist

遊走塔林、柏林和香港三地，早期比較著重於探討動畫形式，現時比較醉心於故事和人物可塑性，尚在遊戲中學習。
於愛沙尼亞藝術學院動畫系兼職講師, 教授碩士生基本動畫藝術及創立“動態風格"課程。

In my early works, they usually drew inspiration from observing the potential of matter and rolling in between the flow of audio-visual relationship. Lately, I am playing around with material, timing and connections to unfold the absurdity in reality.
