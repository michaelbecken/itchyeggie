李 柏 誼  
[Léih Paak Yìh]

Äggie Lee Pak Yee, b. 1989 British Hong Kong, graduated in Estonia

Animated-film Director/ Artist

諗下畫下郁下摸下, 鍾意由一極端跑列另一極端。  
遊走塔林、柏林和香港三地，早期比較著重於探討動畫形式，現時比較醉心於故事和人物可塑性，尚在遊戲中學習。 於愛沙尼亞藝術學院動畫系兼職講師, 創立“動態風格”課程。

In my early works, they usually drew inspiration from observing the potential of objects found in life and rolling in between the flow of audio-visual relationships. Lately, I am playing around with material, timing and connections to unfold the absurdity in reality. Currently in transit, hopping around Tallinn, Berlin and Hong Kong.
